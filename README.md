# Celeste2-GBA **WIP**
A port of Celeste Classic 2 for the GBA. 

Not yet in a playable state. Graphics and audio (music, no sound effects yet) are pretty much working already. When the port is finished I will make the code and my tools open-source. The port will probably be finished next year because I'm quite busy with uni.

# TODO
- fix rest of game logic
- create and implement sfx
- implement rest of render functions (scarf, grapple, maybe more)

# Current Controls
- DPAD for moving
- A/B are jump/grapple
- Select to skip to the next level
